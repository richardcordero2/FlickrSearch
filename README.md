# FlickrSearch
Simple Flickr Search App with endless scrolling.

# How to run:
1. Run pod install in the main directory.
2. Using XCode ~11.3, open the xcworkspace file.
3. Rune the FlickSearch target.

# If given more time, the things to improve are:
- More user facing Error handling.
- Proper exception handling.
- The image views were set to Content Aspect Fill mode for uniformity's sake. This crops out some parts of the images.
- More API logging.
- Objective C and AFNetworking were comfort picks given the time constraints. Swift + Alamofire would've been more up to date.
- If this was going to be a more fleshed out app, more organization of static strings and inline string should be more organized.

# Some more notes:
- It actually took me more than 3 hours for the whole exercise.
  - Just under 3 hours to complete the key requirements.
  - About 3 hours more for testing and polishing.
